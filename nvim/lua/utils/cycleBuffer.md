That's an excellent and insightful question. You're thinking like a programmer, asking if we can avoid re-doing work unnecessarily.

The answer is **yes, we can optimize it**, but it involves a slightly more advanced concept: **caching** combined with Neovim's event system (`autocmd`).

Let me explain the trade-off and then give you the optimized implementation.

### The Optimization Strategy

The goal is to avoid calling `GetBuffersByLastUsed()` on *every single* press of `<Tab>`. We only need to re-calculate the sorted list when the "last used" order has actually changed.

When does the order change?

1. When you enter any buffer (it becomes the new \#1 most recently used).
2. When you open a new buffer.
3. When you close a buffer.

We can use Neovim's event system to detect this. The most important event is `BufEnter`, which fires every time you switch to a different buffer. We'll set up an autocommand that listens for this event and simply "invalidates" our stored list.

**The Optimized Workflow:**

1. Press `<Tab>`. The cycle function checks if it has a stored (cached) list.
2. If it doesn't, it calls `GetBuffersByLastUsed()` once, stores the result, and cycles to the next buffer.
3. Because you entered a new buffer, the `BufEnter` event fires automatically, which clears our stored list.
4. You press `<Tab>` again. The function sees the stored list is gone, so it re-calculates a fresh one and cycles to the next buffer.

This is more performant because if you were to, for example, run a command *without* switching buffers and then press `<Tab>`, the list would not be re-calculated.

### Implementation: A Self-Contained Buffer Cycler Module

This is best implemented as a small, self-contained Lua module. This allows us to properly manage the cached list.

**Step 1: Create the Module File**
Create a new file, for example at: `lua/utils/buffer_cycler.lua`

**Step 2: Add the Following Code**
Paste this entire block of code into the new file. I have combined all the logic into this one module.

```lua
-- In lua/utils/buffer_cycler.lua

local M = {}

-- We will store our sorted list and current position in these private variables.
-- They act as our "cache".
local sorted_buffers_cache = nil
local current_index_cache = nil

--- Invalidates our cached buffer list.
-- This will be called automatically by Neovim events.
local function invalidate_cache()
  sorted_buffers_cache = nil
  current_index_cache = nil
end

--- Gets a list of active buffers, sorted by the most recently used.
-- (This is your function from before)
local function get_buffers_by_last_used()
  local options = { project_only = true } -- Defaulting to project-only
  local items = {}
  local cwd = vim.fn.getcwd() .. "/"
  for _, buf in ipairs(vim.api.nvim_list_bufs()) do
    local name = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(buf)
    local is_in_project = name ~= "" and vim.startswith(name, cwd)
    if vim.api.nvim_buf_is_loaded(buf) and vim.bo[buf].buftype ~= "nofile" and (not options.project_only or is_in_project) and vim.bo[buf].buflisted then
      local info = vim.fn.getbufinfo(buf)[1]
      table.insert(items, { bufnr = buf, lastused = info.lastused })
    end
  end
  table.sort(items, function(a, b)
    return a.lastused > b.lastused
  end)
  return items
end

--- Populates the cache if it's empty.
local function ensure_cache()
  if not sorted_buffers_cache then
    sorted_buffers_cache = get_buffers_by_last_used()
    local current_bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
    for i, buf_info in ipairs(sorted_buffers_cache) do
      if buf_info.bufnr == current_bufnr then
        current_index_cache = i
        break
      end
    end
  end
end

--- Main function to cycle buffers.
---@param direction "next" | "prev"
function M.cycle(direction)
  ensure_cache() -- Make sure our list is populated.

  if not sorted_buffers_cache or #sorted_buffers_cache <= 1 or not current_index_cache then
    return -- Nothing to do
  end

  local next_index
  if direction == "next" then
    next_index = (current_index_cache % #sorted_buffers_cache) + 1
  else -- "prev"
    next_index = (current_index_cache - 2 + #sorted_buffers_cache) % #sorted_buffers_cache + 1
  end

  local next_bufnr = sorted_buffers_cache[next_index].bufnr

  -- Important: We invalidate the cache *before* switching buffers.
  -- The upcoming buffer switch will change the MRU order, so our current
  -- cache will be incorrect for the *next* cycle.
  invalidate_cache()

  vim.cmd.buffer(next_bufnr)
end

--- Sets up the autocommands to automatically invalidate the cache.
function M.setup()
  -- Create an augroup to hold our autocommands, ensuring we don't create duplicates.
  vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("BufferCyclerCache", { clear = true })
  -- When we enter a buffer or create/delete one, our MRU order is invalid.
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "BufEnter", "BufAdd", "BufDelete" }, {
    group = "BufferCyclerCache",
    pattern = "*",
    callback = invalidate_cache,
  })
end

return M
```

### Step 3: Update Your Configuration

Now, you just need to call the `setup` function once from your main config, and update your keymaps.

**1. Call `setup()`:**
In your main configuration file (like `init.lua` or wherever you configure plugins), add this line to activate the caching system:

```lua
require("utils.buffer_cycler").setup()
```

**2. Update your keymaps:**
Change your keymaps to call the `cycle` function from the new module.

```lua
-- In your mappings file
vim.keymap.set("n", "<Tab>", function()
  require("utils.buffer_cycler").cycle("next")
end, { desc = "Cycle to next buffer (MRU)" })

vim.keymap.set("n", "<S-Tab>", function()
  require("utils.buffer_cycler").cycle("prev")
end, { desc = "Cycle to previous buffer (MRU)" })
```

And that's it\! You now have a more performant version that only re-calculates the buffer list when it absolutely has to. While the simpler version is fast enough for almost everyone, this caching pattern is a very powerful technique and a great way to optimize your Neovim configuration.
